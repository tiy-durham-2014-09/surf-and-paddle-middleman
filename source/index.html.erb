      <article><p> 'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter. 'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to
        the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. 'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter
        added as an explanation; 'I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.' Here the Queen put on her
        spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 'Give your evidence,'
        said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.' This did not seem to
        encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the
        Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p>
