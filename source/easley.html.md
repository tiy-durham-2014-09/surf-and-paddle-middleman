title:  "Effect of Turbulent Mixing on Average Fuel Temperatures in a Gas-Core Nuclear Rocket Engine"
date:   "November 1968"

text:   "<pre>A heat-transfer analysis was made for a coaxial-flow nuclear rocket. The analysis considers one-dimensional radial transfer of heat, by both radiation and turbulent mixÂ­ ing from a centrally located fissioning gas to a coaxially flowing propellant. The results compare the effective thermal conductivities for radiation and turbulent mixing. Also included are typical radial-temperature profiles at various axial locations and average fuel temperatures showing the effect of neglecting turbulent mixing. Turbulent mixing had a large effect on local temperature in regions where the fuel density was smallest. Therefore, the effect of turbulent mixing on the average fuel temperature was small."
